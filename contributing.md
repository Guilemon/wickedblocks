**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_
series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## Setting Up the project locally

To install the project you need to have `yarn` and `node`

1.  [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone
    your fork:

    ```
    # Clone your fork
    git clone git clone https://github.com/michael-andreuzza/wickedblocks.git

    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
    cd wickedblocks
    ```

2.  Your environment needs to be running Node v. 10
    - `.nvmrc` config exists in the repo root, specifying a v.10.x.x version
    - you can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (`fnm use`) to change
      your current node version to the one specified in `.nvmrc`
      
3.  from the root of the project: `npm` to install all dependencies
    - make sure you have latest `npm` version
    
4.  from the root of the project.
    - open any pagewith live server.

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```sh
> git remote add wickedbranch https://github.com/michael-andreuzza/wickedblocks.git
> git fetch wickedbranch
> git branch --set-wickedbranch-to=wickedbranch/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "wickedbranch," then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.

## Read Before You Contribute.

Features to improve.

Responsivness
 - Some sections are not responsive, so they need to be responsive, without chanching the aspect of this ones.
 *Note: I did the encoding with this tool. https://www.browserling.com/tools/html-encode
 
POST to Prefill Editors on codepen.
 - Add a button to open on CodePen using the API. Read here for more about POST to Prefill Editors ( https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/prefill/)
 *Note: This button has to be and look the same as the copy-to--clipboard button, and it has to be next to it.

React and Vue markup Code.
- Implement 2 buttons that turns the HTML code into React and Vue. This have to be implemented as a tab, next to the one displaying "code" so they user can se the React and Vue code.



Thing to no worry about.

The site, as mentioned before is made with only Tailwind and Alpinejs. ( icons from tablericons, https://tablericons.com/ )

There is no need to implement react or other proggraming languages. WickedBlocks is meant to be a project to come and work, is not made to show off our skills. With this I mean that there is no need to implement animations, innecesary code and so on... is a simple but helpful project.





Thank you for taking the time to contribute! üëç
