## WICKEDBLOCKS.
WICKEDBLOCKS are a growing collection of more than 120 layout blocks and components built with Tailwind CSS V2 ready to copy paste on your Tailwind project.


## Why WICKEDBLOCKS?
Because we ain't got time for that...so let's be productive and deploy our work even quicker.

## Buildt status.
Superb, all working.

## Code Style.
 I have used Headwind for VS Code "as is", no configuration, nothing, nada, so the way to tidy up the classes is the original Headwing way to do it, but I have probably messed up somewhere, because Headwind was quicker than me to move the class 1 or 2 spaces to left or right.

For example, this is a paragraph:

```
<p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed text-center text-gray-700 lg:text-left lg:text-1xl">

              <!---- Text goes here ----->    
	      
</p>
```

## Tech stack.
The blocks are written with only HTML and style with Tailwind CSS V2 as it says on the site...for navigation and other I used Alpine.js and because that's the point of them.

## Features.
Right now, what you can do is:

- See the code.
- Copy the code to clipboard.

Too many, right? Comming more soon.
