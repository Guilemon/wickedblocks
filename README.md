## WICKEDBLOCKS.
WICKEDBLOCKS are a growing collection of more than 120 layout blocks and components built with Tailwind CSS V2 ready to copy paste on your Tailwind project.


## Why WICKEDBLOCKS?
Because we ain't got time for that...so let's be productive and deploy our work even quicker.

## Buildt status.
Superb, all working.

## Code Style.
 I have used Headwind for VS Code "as is", no configuration, nothing, nada, so the way to tidy up the classes is the original Headwing way to do it, but I have probably messed up somewhere, because Headwind was quicker than me to move the class 1 or 2 spaces to left or right.

For example, this is a paragraph:

```
<p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed text-center text-gray-700 lg:text-left lg:text-1xl">

              <!---- Text goes here ----->    
	      
</p>
```

## Tech stack.
The blocks are written with only HTML and style with Tailwind CSS V2 as it says on the site...for navigation and other I used Alpine.js and because that's the point of them.


## How to use WickedBlocks.
- Navigato to https://blocks.wickedtemplates.com/
- Choose the block/section that you neadd for your project.
- Visualize the markup, HTML by selecting the tab "code".
- Click on the copy icon.
- Paste into your project.

*The sections are having the same padding, you can go ahead to change it to yours. I personally would recommend to use px-5 lg:px-20 or lg:px-24 on all your sections. so you can have a nice white space and consistence.

*The sections when you copy them are commented, remember to remove the arrows wrapping the markup.
